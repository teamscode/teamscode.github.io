    <b>TeamsCode</b> is a student-run pending 501(c)(3) non-profit that works to 
    encourage high school students to study computer science. We work with the 
    Computer Science Teacher's Association and other sponsors to create awesome 
    programming contests with free snacks, pizza, medals, and prizes!
    <br></br>
    In addition to organizing programming contests, TeamsCode builds online programming 
    lessons in order to prepare students for the AP Computer Science A exam. We create 
    a selection of programming problems, giving students early experience with complex 
    data structures and algorithms.
    <br></br>
    Within the next few months, TeamsCode also hopes to organize other programming 
    events, such as bootcamps and hackathons. We strive to provide valuable experience 
    to high schoolers pursuing careers in the computer science industry. 
    <br></br>
    Finally, TeamsCode encourages other students to create their own programming contests. 
    We provide students with valuable support and resources to organize events at venues 
    around the Pacific Northwest. Please visit our
    <a class="a" href="/contests/create">create page</a> to create your own event!
