    <b>TeamsCode</b> is a student-run 501(c)(3) non-profit that works to encourage middle school
    and high school students to study computer science. We work with teachers and sponsors to
    create awesome programming contests – both online and in-person!
    <br></br>
    Chris Elliott and Alan Bi founded TeamsCode in the beginning of 2017. Both of them participated
    in local programming contests and noticed a lack of representation from their school.
    They set about to change that by organizing the first ever Mercer Island High School Programming
    Contest on April 1st, 2017. Since then, TeamsCode has expanded its influence across three states
    and hopes to continue growing.
    <br></br>
    In addition to organizing programming contests, TeamsCode writes free, online programming lessons
    to create a lower entry barrier for computer science education. We also encourage students to
    sharpen their algorithmic skills by solving our past contest problems through <em>Launch Test Run</em>,
    an interactive system that judges code submissions in real-time!
    <br></br>
    We are always open to students who are interested in helping us organize our contests.
    If you would like to join our team, <a class="a" href="/contests/create">apply here</a>!
    We'll see if you're a good fit for our team.
