## About <u>Smart Coding School</u>:

Smart Coding School is a computer science education school established in March 2016. We develop computer science & engineering curriculum and offer courses for middle school and high school students (12 ~ 18 years old), and mainly provide Java Programming, data structures and algorithms, computer science A AP Test Prep and USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) training courses. In 2017 Computer Science A AP Test, there are 95% students receiving 5 out of 5 scores. Many students successfully got into Platinum, Gold and Silver level in USA Computing Olympiad competition. In the local coding competitions, our students took 2nd place in the advanced level and 1st place in the intermediate level.

Smart Coding School is powered by passionate software engineers from local top hi-tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft. We believe that early computer science education can make a big difference for students. Our passion is to inspire kids & teens to see things differently from engineering perspectives and to believe that they can make a big impact through technology. Smart Coding School is all about students and prepare students for the future with technology.

# Scoring #

**Overview:** There will be many programming problems, sorted by difficulty from easiest to hardest. All problems will be worth 50 points maximum. Each incorrect submission will reduce the points received from that problem by 5 upon completion. The three teams with the highest scores will receive medals. If there is a tie in points, the winner is decided by the team that completed their last problem first.

**Input and Output:** Read input from text file and output to console (answers checked manually by judges).

**Sample Problem:** You are facing off against a golem. In order to beat it, you must cast a magic spell. You are given two numbers. Your task is to find the largest number possible either by adding or multiplying the two numbers together in order to cast the strongest spell.

**Input:** The first line contains an integer L. The following L lines will each contain two numbers, N1 and N2.

**Output:** For each set of two numbers, print the largest number possible through either adding or multiplying the two numbers together.

**Example Input:**
