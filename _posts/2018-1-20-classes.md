A **class** is the overall template that includes everything that describes a specific type of variable. Classes consist of a collection of similar methods and variables that together describe the various behaviors of some new thing. An **object** is a single instance of that class, and contains the class’s various properties/behaviors (which are variables and methods). The following image is an analogy for a class and its instances.

As you can see from the above image, a class is the blueprint used to create new objects, which can then be used for a variety of different tasks. Objects, especially their differences with primitives, will be covered in more depth in **<a href="../objects">lesson #31 (Objects)</a>**.

Although you have already been using classes, this lesson will go more in-depth on what makes a class and how a class is used.  For example, the statement <code>Math.abs(-2)</code> is a method inside of the <code>Math</code> class. To better understand the concept of classes, let’s look at a new example. Below is a rudimentary class that represents someone’s email account.

        public class EmailAccount {


            private String username;

            private String password;

            // constructor (explained next lesson) that creates new email account

            public EmailAccount(String username, String password) {

                this.username = username;

                this.password = this.password;

                createAccount(username, password);

            }

            public void createAccount(String username, String password) {

                /* implementation code */

            }

            public void sendEmail(String message, String recipient) {

                /* implementation code */

            }

            public void readEmails() {

                /* implementation code */

            }

        }

The above class demonstrates the basic syntax of the class. Here is an image dividing the above class into its main sections:

<img src="/assets/lesson_images/class_makeup.png" width="650">

The class header consists of an access modifier (<code>public/private</code>), the keyword <code>class</code>, and the class name. The class name is structured using CamelCasing, but where the first letter is capitalized (as opposed to lowercase in methods/variables). In the next lesson, we’ll explain the use of fields, constructors, and creating instances of classes.

<h1>Lesson Quiz</h1>

<h3>1. What is a class?</h3>

<form>
	<div>
		<input type="radio" value="a" name="cc" onchange="check(this, 'b')">
		a. A group of topics combined into a single text document.
	</div>
	<div>
		<input type="radio" value="b" name="cc" onchange="check(this, 'b')">
		b. A software "blueprint" that describes the data and properties of an object.
	</div>
	<div>
		<input type="radio" value="c" name="cc" onchange="check(this, 'b')">
		c. A destination where programmers go to collaborate and share code.
	</div>
    <div>
		<input type="radio" value="d" name="cc" onchange="check(this, 'b')">
		d. A list of field variables.
	</div>
</form>

<h3>2. What are classes used for?</h3>

<form>
	<div>
		<input type="radio" value="a" name="cc" onchange="check(this, 'a')">
		a. Classes model specific behaviors and store data using methods and variables.
	</div>
	<div>
		<input type="radio" value="b" name="cc" onchange="check(this, 'a')">
		b. Classes are solely used to print things.
	</div>
	<div>
		<input type="radio" value="c" name="cc" onchange="check(this, 'a')">
		c. Classes are used to create new methods and variables.
	</div>
    <div>
		<input type="radio" value="d" name="cc" onchange="check(this, 'a')">
		d. Classes group programs to enhance readability.
	</div>
</form>
