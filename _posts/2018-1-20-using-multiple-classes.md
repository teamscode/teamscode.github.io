Making classes in IntelliJ only requires a few easy steps. First, make sure you see the following sidebar:

<img src="/assets/lesson_images/intellij_sidebar.png" width="400">

Next, right-click on **src**, and click **New → Java Class**. Name your class, and a new class template should be automatically constructed:

<img src="/assets/lesson_images/intellij_class_with_sidebar.png" width="600">

**Note:** Remember that if you want to change the class name, you need to change both the class name and the file name to avoid producing an error (the class name and file name must match).

Almost every class contains three crucial parts: methods, **fields**, and **constructors**. We have already worked with methods, and understand that they are a group of statements that combine to perform a specific operation. Fields are variables that are inside a class, but made outside of methods. Additionally, they are usually declared as <code>private</code> to limit who has access to these variables (more on this in **<a href="../method-types">lesson #29, Method Types</a>**). For example:

        public class Dog {

            private int age; // field variable

            private String type; // field variable

            private String gender = "male"; // field variable (can be defined here)

            public static void main(String[] args) {

                int length = 50; // non-field variable (created inside a method)

                age = 5; // still field variable (created outside main method)

            }

            /* implementation code */

        }

As you can see, field variables can be **_assigned a value_** anywhere in the class, they just must be **_created (declared)_** outside a method, at the top of the class. Fields can be accessed in instances of the class. For example, the array object has a property called <code>.length</code>. Notice how there are no parenthesis following <code>.length</code>; this means that <code>.length</code> is a field of the array object.

Using the above example of class <code>Dog</code>, you can create a <code>Dog</code> object and print the gender field as follows:

        Dog myDog = new Dog();

        System.out.println(dog.gender); // prints "male"

Now, another very important aspect of classes is the constructor. The constructor has three important rules:

1. It is called whenever a new instance of a class is created.

2. It has no return type.

3. It <u>must</u> have the same name as the class.

The syntax of a constructor, using the above <code>Dog</code> class, is:

        public *CLASSNAME* (*PARAMETERS*) {

            /* implementation code */

        }

As you can see, the constructor does not have a return type. This is because the constructor does not return anything, and its role is to create a new object with specific properties (you can think of this like a <code>void</code> method with a very specific job).

Now, examine the following <code>EmailAccount</code> class. If the constructor had two <code>String</code> parameters (username and password), the constructor would be:

        public class EmailAccount {

            

            // field variables

            private String username;

            private String password;

            // constructor

            public EmailAccount(String usernameInput, String passwordInput) {

                // setting field variables equal to user input

                username = usernameInput;

                password = passwordInput;

            }

        }

In the above code segment, the constructor assigns the field variables <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> to the parameters the user givers when creating a new instance of the <code>EmailAccount</code> class. This allows the user to create multiple different email accounts, each with a different username and password. For example, the syntax for creating a new <code>EmailAccount</code> object is as follows:

<img src="/assets/lesson_images/object_creation_syntax.png" width="600">

There are two parts to this code segment – the variable declaration and variable assignment. Although this code segment may look different, it is essentially like creating any other variable. You can see the similarities and differences between the two variables below:

        int myNumber = 25;

        /* myNumber is type int, myNumber equals 25 */


        EmailAccount myEmail = new EmailAccount("John", “Password1234”);

        /* myEmail is type EmailAccount, myEmail is an EmailAccount object
        with a username of "John" and a password of “Password1234” */

In the above code, <code>new EmailAccount("John", “Password1234”)</code> is when the constructor of the class is called with the parameters of “John” and “Password1234”. The constructor is then used to create a new email account for John with a password of “Password1234”.

Sometimes, there are no parameters when creating a new object – this means that either the constructor has no parameters or the class is using a **default constructor**, which is a constructor generated by the computer because the programmer did not create a constructor. A default constructor requires no parameters, so if the <code>EmailAccount</code> class had a default constructor, its instance would be declared as follows:

        EmailAccount myEmail = new EmailAccount(); // no parameters

Next, let’s learn how to call methods in other classes. So far, we have only called methods inside the same class they were created. However, in order to call a method from a different class, different syntax is needed. Let’s examine the following code:

        public class Class1 {

            public void printNumber(int num) {

                System.out.println(num);

            }

        }

        public class Class2 {

            public static void main(String[] args) {

                /* your code here */

            }

        }

In this code segment, we have two different classes. <code>Class1</code> has a method named <code>printNumber</code> which prints an input number to the console. If we want to run <code>printNumber</code> from the main method in <code>Class2</code>, we must first create a <code>Class1</code> object, shown here:

	    Class1 myInstance = new Class1(); // default constructor – no parameters

Now, there are two main types of method calls, static and non-static. The real differences between static and non-static methods will be covered in **<a href="../method-types">lesson #29 (Method Types)</a>**, but for now you simply need to understand the difference in their method calls. Since the <code>printNumber</code> method is non-static, use the following syntax to call the <code>printNumber</code> method:

<img src="/assets/lesson_images/class_method_call.png" width="400">

As you can see, this is the same syntax as the other method call, but now we simply add the object name and a dot in the front. Altogether, the new code would print <code>26</code>:

        public class Class1 {

            // non-static method

            public void printNumber(int number) {

                System.out.println(number);

            }

        }

        public class Class2 {

            public static void main(String[] args) {

                Class1 myInstance = new Class1(); // instance of Class1

                myInstance.printNumber(26); // non-static method call

            }

        }

However, if the <code>printNumber</code> method was static, then you do not need to create an instance of the class. Instead, the method call uses the class name instead of an instance, as shown here:

        Class1.printNumber(26); // static method call

Overall, classes are very useful to programmers for creating new objects in order to build complex programs. Understanding class structure and syntax is very important to being able to create and use the variety of classes that Java offers.
